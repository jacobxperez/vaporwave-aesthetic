## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/vaporwave/archive/master.zip)** the [repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/vaporwave) or by cloning the project:

	$ git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/vaporwave.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Vaporwave](https://jacobxperez.github.io/vaporwave/) in your projects is by copying the pre-compiled CSS file into your project folder and then link to it in HTML.

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/vaporwave/tree/master/css)
	* [style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/vaporwave/blob/master/css/style.css)

### Custom Build

Adjust the [variables](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/variables.less) and if needed, add [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/custom.less) code then compile everything together in [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css). Optional, comment out unwanted components from [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) then compile your project. Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins) for compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).
