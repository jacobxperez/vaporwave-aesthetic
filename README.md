## Getting Started

*Keep in mind that this project is under active development and no stable version has been release.*

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) in your projects is by copying the pre-compiled CSS file into your project folder, and then link to it in HTML.

* [/css/style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)

### Custom Build

[Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) is build on [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) which extends the capabilities of CSS. Use [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) for compiling all necessary modules for your website and [settings.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/settings.less) for adjusting the values of fonts, colors, padding and more.

* [/css/style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) (for compiling all LESS modules)
* [/css/less/settings.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/settings.less) (for changing the settings)

All main components and dependencies can be found under folder [core](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core).

* [/css/less/core](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core)
	* [reset](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/reset)
	* [layout](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/layout)
	* [mixins](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/core/mixins)

We recommend to add all extra modules under folder [components](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components) then link to them on file [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) for compiling.

* [/css/less/components](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components)
	* [modules](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components/modules)
	* [navigation](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/components/navigation)

*At this stage of development Essentials has no predefine navigation.*

## Design Principles

Leo Babauta demonstrates in he's book The Power of Less how to streamline your life by identifying the essential and eliminating the unnecessary. By focusing on the essential and allowing everything else to drop away you will become less stressed and more productive.

1. Identify the essential
2. Eliminate the rest
